it has just occurred to me that i have chosen the worst of 2 worlds

i chose to axe the ability to focus on a unit and then i made a worse version Y^Y help me

also the unit movement goes haywire if it's behind the camera

here's my proposed fix, which you should re-evaluate before you implement later

1) use the commented out alignment code to make it revert to absolute vector inputs when the units are behind the camera
2) re-implement locking the camera to units, but just have it follow their position (instead of reparenting, that was stupid)
