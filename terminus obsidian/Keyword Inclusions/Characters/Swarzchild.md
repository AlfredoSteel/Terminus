Saboteur

I do not attack.

Event Horizon: Enemies within a certain radius (range) of me take damage (damage) every second (attack speed) [[tick rate]].

[[on hit]]- [[slow]] enemies for 2 seconds (damage) by (20 - 60%) scaling with their distance away from me.   

  

I gain 1 stack of accretion each time I [[slow]] an enemy. I have +10 HP for each stack of accretion.
