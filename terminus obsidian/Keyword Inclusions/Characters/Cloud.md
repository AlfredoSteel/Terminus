Controller

Cloud’s base form is not naturally occurring. Instead, one of his alternate forms is selected at random.

Passive: I leave a cloud around and behind me that deals 1 true damage every second. If you ever have three different alt copies of Cloud, merge them all into Chromatic Cloud.

  

Alt: Poison - Proc: Apply 1 stack of [[Poison]]. (low number because self-apply)

Alt: Glue - Proc: Apply 50% [[slow]].

Alt: Psychic - Proc: Apply 50% [[weak]]

Alt: Ice - Proc: Apply 50% [[chill]]

Alt: Acid - Proc: Apply 50% [[vulnerable]]

Alt: Scrap - Apply 50% [[wound]] 

Alt: Smoke - Apply 50% [[blind]]

Alt: Chromatic Legendary (All of the above)
